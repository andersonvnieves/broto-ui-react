# BrotoUI for React 
[![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/)

BrotoUI is a side project of Mangos, my personal finance app.
While developing a design system for Mangos, I decided to publish it separately as a standalone React UI component library.
This way, I can reuse it not only in Mangos but also across any of my future projects.

As the name suggests, in Portuguese “broto” means “sprout”, which conveys the idea of something evolving and growing over time — just like this library.
